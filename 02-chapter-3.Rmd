## Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) for a simple linear regression 

OLS helps answer the question of what is the effect of a variable X on Y, how to predict Y based on X, and how to forecast future values for future periods. 
OLS helps to estimate unknown parameters for a subset of a population (i.e. sample) and minimize errors/disturbances through minimizing the sum of squared residuals.

### Types of data suitable for econometric analyses
1. cross sectional data
2. time series data
3. panel data
